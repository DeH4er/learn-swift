# Learn Swift

This is a project to learn Swift, SwiftUI and iOS development.
If you think it looks like Opal app, it's because it was used as a reference. 
All the props for good design should go for the team behind Opal app.
All props for bad design should go to me.
Nothing in this project is actually functional, it's just a playground to learn.
